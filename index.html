            Rebuilding Better and Greener from the COVID-19 Pandemic</h1>
       
        <p>Policymakers in developing countries face many challenges to charting a path to sustainable development and achieving much-needed progress towards achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These challenges have only grown more formidable in light of multiple global crises on food, energy and finance, which have set many countries back on their development path. One of these challenges is the often insufficient evidence base that policymakers have at their disposal to build strategies for sustainable and inclusive development. There is a need to improve access to data and strengthen the capacity of decision-makers to analyse and use that data to shed light on the many trade-offs countries face in the policymaking process in order to improve the policymaking process and achieve optimal development outcomes. The Economic Analysis Policy Division, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, United Nations, will implement the present capacity development project for over 10 target countries during 2023-2027, with a total budget of $2 million funded by the Peace and Development Fund, the 2030 Agenda Sub-fund.</p>
        
        <h2>OBJECTIVE</h2>
        <p>This project aims to strengthen the capacity of Government agencies to better utilize data and analytical techniques through the use of modelling tools with a view to strengthening the analytic foundations and evidence base of policies and strategies for sustainable and inclusive development.</p>
        
        <h2>METHODOLOGY</h2>
        <p>The project will transfer a set of innovative tools to support countries, including, the World Economic Forecasting Model (WEFM), Overlapping Generation Core (OG-Core) model, Climate, Land, Energy and Water Systems (CLEWS) tool, and micro-simulation methodologies, if feasible. WEFM is used for simulations at country level that allows users to specify alternative scenarios about the possible policy interventions and trace macro-economic outcomes over short, medium and long-term timescales. The OG-Core full-economy macroeconomic model can help policymakers design more effective and sustainable economic policies that cater to the needs of diverse population groups and is particularly useful to study taxation and spending policies, social protection and pension systems, transfers, savings behaviour, technological progress, and the effect of demographic changes. CLEWS provides a means to analyse and assess the interlinkages that exist among energy, water and agricultural systems as well as their impacts on—and vulnerability to—climate change. It is designed to help identify and quantify the trade-offs and synergies that may exist in simultaneous pursuit of policy goals in each area. The proposed project beneficiaries include government ministries and agencies as well as academic and research institutions, NGOs, and other relevant stakeholders.</p>
        
        <h2>EXPECTED OUTCOMES</h2>
        <p>The successful adoption of these tools and methodologies is expected to result in a number of direct benefits, first and foremost improved analytic capacity for decision-making and national planning processes that can help government ministries and agencies, as well as other stakeholders, improve their work and better fulfil their roles and mandates. In particular, having in-house (or at least in-country) capacity for analysis will allow national stakeholders to stay better abreast of development outcomes by strengthening their ability to conduct continuous monitoring and analysis of development. It can also help clearly delineate what options are open to policy makers and what the likely impacts are. This will improve stakeholder decision-making capacity, by ensuring a stronger evidence base and analytic foundations for policy discourse while ensuring that policy is appropriate and effective.</p>
        
        <h2>MAJOR DELIVERABLES</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Reports on planning gaps and data availability identifying the areas in national development planning which the enhanced capacity will make the most contributions to and assessing the feasibility of applying the identified modeling approaches;</li>
            <li>Macro-economic, micro-simulation or CLEWs integrated modelling tools customized for each country, adapted for the unique circumstances of selected countries to inform COVID-19 recovery strategies and SDG implementation;</li>
            <li>National training workshops for each country on the policy simulation tools;</li>
            <li>Development of policy documents using the simulation results; and</li>
            <li>Support to target countries to enhance national engagement in regional policy dialogues, and global meetings including ECOSOC, General Assembly, HLPF, and other international fora.</li>
